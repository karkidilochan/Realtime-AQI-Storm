# **Real-Time Air Quality and Weather Monitoring Using Apache Storm ‚õÖüöÄ**

This project implements a **real-time streaming data processing system** using **Apache Storm** to analyze **air quality levels** and **cloud coverage** across the U.S. The system ingests live weather data, applies **approximate frequency counting** using the **Lossy Counting Algorithm**, and generates top-k state reports for each category in real time.

---

## **Features üõ†Ô∏è**
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Uses Apache Storm to ingest and analyze live weather data.
- **Approximate Frequency Counting**: Implements the Lossy Counting algorithm for real-time top-k state estimation.
- **Scalable and Parallel Architecture**: Implements both **non-parallel** and **parallel** topologies with multiple computing nodes.
- **Cloud-Based Forecasting**: Integrates 3-day weather forecasts for cloud coverage analysis.
- **Optimized Performance**: Uses distributed processing and load balancing for efficient computation.

## **System Architecture üèóÔ∏è**
The system consists of two **Storm topologies**:
1. **Non-Parallel Topology** ‚Äì Computes top 5 states per **EPA Air Quality Level**.
2. **Parallel Topology** ‚Äì Computes top 5 states per **Cloud Coverage Level** over a 3-day forecast.

### **1. Data Sources üåç**
- **WeatherAPI.com** ‚Äì Provides real-time and forecasted weather data (API integration required).
- **US Zip Code Dataset** ‚Äì Maps zip codes to states.

### **2. Apache Storm Components ‚ö°**
- **Spouts**:
  - **WeatherSpout**: Fetches live weather data for all zip codes.
  - **ForecastSpout**: Fetches 3-day cloud coverage forecasts.
  
- **Bolts**:
  - **LossyCountingBolt**: Implements the Lossy Counting algorithm for approximate top-k estimation.
  - **AggregationBolt**: Aggregates results and prepares reports.
  - **StorageBolt**: Saves reports to files.

## **Data Processing Workflow üîÑ**
1. **Spouts** fetch real-time weather and forecast data.
2. **Bolts** process the stream using the **Lossy Counting Algorithm**.
3. **AggregationBolt** computes **top-k states** per category.
4. **StorageBolt** logs results in the following format:

```plaintext
<timestamp> <air_quality_level> <state1> <count1> <state2> <count2> ... <state5> <count5>
<timestamp> <cloud_coverage_level> <state1> <count1> <state2> <count2> ... <state5> <count5>
```
